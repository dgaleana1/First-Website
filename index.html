        <h4> What is it? </h4>
        <p><h5>"At its most basic, neuroscience is the study of the nervous system from structure to function, development to degeneration, in health and in disease. It covers the whole nervous system, with a primary focus on the brain. Incredibly complex, our brains define who we are and what we do." Said Kings College London</h5></p>

        <h4> What does a neuroscientist do? </h4>
        <p><h5> "Neuroscientists focus on the brain and its impact on behavior and cognitive functions. Not only is neuroscience concerned with the normal functioning of the nervous system, but also what happens to the nervous system when people have neurological, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders" Said the Department of Neuroscience at Georgetown University. </h5></p>
